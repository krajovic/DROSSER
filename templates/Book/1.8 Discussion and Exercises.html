The List, USet, and SSet interfaces described in
Section <a href="http://opendatastructures.org/ods-python/1_2_Interfaces.html#sec:interfaces">1.2</a> are influenced by the Java Collections Framework
[<a href="http://opendatastructures.org/ods-python/Bibliography.html#oracle_collections">54</a>].
<a name="2957"></a>These are essentially simplified versions of
the List, Set, Map, SortedSet, and SortedMap interfaces found in
the Java Collections Framework.

For a superb (and free) treatment of the mathematics discussed in this
chapter, including asymptotic notation, logarithms, factorials, Stirling's
approximation, basic probability, and lots more, see the textbook by
Leyman, Leighton, and Meyer [<a href="http://opendatastructures.org/ods-python/Bibliography.html#llm11">50</a>].  For a gentle calculus text
that includes formal definitions of exponentials and logarithms, see the
(freely available) classic text by Thompson [<a href="http://opendatastructures.org/ods-python/Bibliography.html#t14">71</a>].
</p><p>
For more information on basic probability, especially as it relates to
computer science, see the textbook by Ross [<a href="http://opendatastructures.org/ods-python/Bibliography.html#r01">63</a>].  Another good
reference, which covers both asymptotic notation and probability, is
the textbook by Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik [<a href="http://opendatastructures.org/ods-python/Bibliography.html#gkp94">37</a>].

</p><div><b>Exercise  <span class="arabic">1</span>..<span class="arabic">1</span></b>   
This exercise is designed to help familiarize the reader with choosing
  the right data structure for the right problem.  If implemented, the
  parts of this exercise should be done by making use of an implementation
  of the relevant interface (Stack, Queue, Deque, USet, or SSet)
  provided by the .
<p>
Solve the following problems by reading a text file one line at a
  time and performing operations on each line in the appropriate data
  structure(s).  Your implementations should be fast enough that even
  files containing a million lines can be processed in a few seconds.
  
</p><ol>
<li>Read the input one line at a time and then write the lines out
      in reverse order, so that the last input line is printed first,
      then the second last input line, and so on.
<p>
</p></li>
<li>Read the first 50 lines of input and then write them out in
      reverse order. Read the next 50 lines and then write them out in
      reverse order. Do this until there are no more lines left to read,
      at which point any remaining lines should be output in reverse
      order.
<p>
In other words, your output will start with the 50th line, then
      the 49th, then the 48th, and so on down to the first line. This
      will be followed by the 100th line, followed by the 99th, and so
      on down to the 51st line. And so on.
</p><p>
Your code should never have to store more than 50 lines at any
      given time.
</p><p>
</p></li>
<li>Read the input one line at a time.
      At any point after reading the first 42 lines, if some line is blank
      (i.e., a string of length 0), then output the line that occured
      42 lines prior to that one. For example, if Line 242 is blank,
      then your program should output line 200. This program should
      be implemented so that it never stores more than 43 lines of the
      input at any given time.
<p>
</p></li>
<li>Read the input one line at a time and write each line to the
      output if it is not a duplicate of some previous input line. Take
      special care so that a file with a lot of duplicate lines does not
      use more memory than what is required for the number of unique lines.
<p>
</p></li>
<li>Read the input one line at a time and write each line to the
      output only if you have already read this line before. (The end
      result is that you remove the first occurrence of each line.)
      Take special care so that a file with a lot of duplicate lines
      does not use more memory than what is required for the number of
      unique lines.
<p>
</p></li>
<li>Read the entire input one line at a time. Then output all lines
      sorted by length, with the shortest lines first. In the case where
      two lines have the same length, resolve their order using the usual
      ``sorted order.''  Duplicate lines should be printed only once.
<p>
</p></li>
<li>Do the same as the previous question except that duplicate lines
      should be printed the same number of times that they appear in the input.
<p>
</p></li>
<li>Read the entire input one line at a time and then output the
      even numbered lines (starting with the first line, line 0) followed
      by the odd-numbered lines.
<p>
</p></li>
<li>Read the entire input one line at a time and randomly permute
      the lines before outputting them.  To be clear: You should not
      modify the contents of any line. Instead, the same collection of
      lines should be printed, but in a random order.
