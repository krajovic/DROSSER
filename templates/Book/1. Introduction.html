<span class="arabic">1</span>. Introduction</a>
</h1>
<p>
Every computer science curriculum in the world includes a course on data
structures and algorithms.  Data structures are <span class="textit">that</span> important;
they improve our quality of life and even save lives on a regular basis.
Many multi-million and several multi-billion dollar companies have been
built around data structures.
</p><p>
How can this be?  If we stop to think about it, we realize that we
interact with data structures constantly.
</p><ul>
<li>Open a file: File system 
    <a name="594"></a>data structures are used to locate
    the parts of that file on disk so they can be retrieved.  This isn't
    easy; disks contain hundreds of millions of blocks.  The contents of your
    file could be stored on any one of them.
</li>
<li>Look up a contact on your phone:  A data
    structure is used to look up a phone number in your contact list
    <a name="595"></a>based on partial
    information even before you finish dialing/typing.  This isn't easy;
    your phone may contain information about a lot of people--everyone
    you have ever contacted via phone or email--and your phone doesn't
    have a very fast processor or a lot of memory.
</li>
<li>Log in to your favourite social network:
    <a name="596"></a>The network servers
    use your login information to look up your account information.
    This isn't easy; the most popular social networks have hundreds of
    millions of active users.
</li>
<li>Do a web search:
    <a name="597"></a>The search engine uses data structures to find
    the web pages containing your search terms.  This isn't easy; there
    are over 8.5 billion web pages on the Internet and each page contains
    a lot of potential search terms.
</li>
<li>Phone emergency services (9-1-1):
    <a name="598"></a><a name="599"></a>The emergency services network
    looks up your phone number in a data structure that maps phone numbers
    to addresses so that police cars, ambulances, or fire trucks can be
    sent there without delay. This is important;  the person making the
    call may not be able to provide the exact address they are calling
    from and a delay can mean the difference between life or death.
</li>
</ul>
